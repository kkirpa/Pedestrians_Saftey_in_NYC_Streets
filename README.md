# Transportation_Data_Science_Project

This project is a part of the accelerated research program that provided us with an opportunity to gain practical experience with data science by creating data-driven recommendations to make roads safer for all. This Transportation Data Science Project (TDSP) was brought to us by the Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub (NEBDHub), National Student Data Corps (NSDC), and U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration.
